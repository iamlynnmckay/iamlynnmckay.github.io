So I thought I ought to make a first post for this website.

You may notice that I've backdated this post to January 1st, 1970 -- the beginning of history accoring to [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). This is so that this post always remains the original post on this website.

It is, so to speak, the beginning of its history.

I'll probably come back to this post now and again, making edits and perfecting it. Of course, that is only if I don't get bored and abandon this project before then.

I don't know what I want this website to be, or to become. I don't know what it's purpose is yet, or at least, not entirely. 

All I know is that this website exists for me to write things down, and that doing so is useful. 

I am Lynn McKay and this is my things and stuff.
