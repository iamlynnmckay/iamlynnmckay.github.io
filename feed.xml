<p>You may notice that I’ve backdated this post to January 1st, 1970 – the beginning of history accoring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>. This is so that this post always remains the original post on this website.</p>

<p>It is, so to speak, the beginning of its history.</p>

<p>I’ll probably come back to this post now and again, making edits and perfecting it. Of course, that is only if I don’t get bored and abandon this project before then.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I want this website to be, or to become. I don’t know what it’s purpose is yet, or at least, not entirely.</p>

<p>All I know is that this website exists for me to write things down, and that doing so is useful.</p>

<p>I am Lynn McKay and this is my things and stuff.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="iamlynnmckay" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I thought I ought to make a first post for this website.]]></summary></entry></feed>
