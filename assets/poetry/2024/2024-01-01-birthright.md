# Birthright

As a trans woman 
I have sat like a pig on a man cock 
In a one night hotel room, 
Waiting for him to ejaculate, 
Pretending to enjoy 
More than how it feels 
To be of woman 
As negation of men. 

As a trans woman 
I have lay beside him 
In a one night hotel room; 
We cuddle because he is weak too, and 
We watch John Wick to conclusion 
Until he leaves, 
And I take a bath,  
Leaving like a used whore 
At four and thirty in the morning.

As a trans woman 
The hotel staff know me by now, 
(For this is not the first time), but 
They know not what I am 
And think me a cheap prostitute, 
And I am grateful. 

As a trans woman 
I loved every moment 
As negation of men, 
I felt whole and hole, 
I felt nothing but empty - 
He is a Good Man. 
The last good man, perhaps. 
He is a friend 
But he is a Man. 
And so I hate it too. 
I hated every moment too. 

As a trans woman 
I bore his cock in my mouth, 
Before drinks and talk, 
Bored and thinking 
Of tax returns and train fares, 
Of hair in my teeth 
And a lack of toothpicks. 

As a trans woman 
I am used and have used equally. 
And for you, a feminist, 
To blame men is not explanation, 
Nor even mere excuse, 
But denial of my agency. 
I wanted what I wanted for me. 
I cared less for him than me. 
Men are so emotional 
Yet do not know how 
To hire a U-Haul.

As a trans woman 
I hate women 
More than I hate men. 
I hate women, 
And I hate men most of all. 
Unfortunately 
I am woman, 
I hate 
As women must. 

As a trans woman 
I am a cis woman, 
As cis are trans women, 
As women are 
As anti-men 
As pussy hole 
Or so imagined 
Close enough 
With enough 
Cheap lube. 

As a trans woman 
I exist only in a hotel room - 
Which he paid for, 
So I owe him 
He does not think so, recall 
He is a Good Man - 
But I want him to, 
It is my excuse to 
Betray my kind. 

As a trans woman 
I reap what I sow 
In the field my husband 
Stole by our union.
